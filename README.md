# Stop webex flash
Webex meetings keeps flashing for any minuscule notification? Then this is for you. And fuck you webex!

I know this is a very small application, but I guess most folks would not be able to solve this issue, and cisco surely doesn't care.
There are some issues, for example, I can't prevent the window from flashing, but I can reset it every 10ms or so, so that it is stopped right in its tracks!

Here you go, join me and say fuck you webex! Happy meetings, with no flashing.

## How to use
Just run the application and it will stop webex from flashing. If you wish to close the application the icon will be in the icon tray.
